Extras:
(a) Implemented 2 blend files with same scene as Binary_primitives.json and simple_phong.json named as Binary.blend and blend_for_json.blend
(b) Implemented a script to load any json in blend named Json_blend.py
(c) Multi Threading approach
(d) Linear mapping with gamma correction and also implemented reinhardToneMapping
(F) Created a table for Time difference between without sample tracing and BVH based Tracing and  sampled tracing 
(E) Material Metal, Dielectric and Diffuse but could not get perfect json to implement it.
(F) Two type of images are saved one is Lambertian saving them another is linear corrected with gamma.
(H) created Custom json with emission to check path tracing and its output.
